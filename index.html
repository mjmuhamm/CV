  <li>	Successfully calculated breakdown cost (yoy) and isolated top causes for breakdowns. This project led to creating the Foreign Object Debris Initiative that decreased ‘FOD’ Breakdowns by 70% / 6mo</li>
      <p class="p1"> &#x25A0;  The FOD Initiative became cross-functional very quickly. I worked directly with the Analytics Manager in creating an algorithm to guestimate the total daily (+hourly) cost for operations and engineering staff. I worked with the parts department to isolate the cost of each part and the traveling time of parts to mechanics. I worked with on-ground operations staff to aid in the re-training of their employees and to attain feedback on an incentive approach. And I also included the Internal Securities staff who managed the process of open packages found and not registered by our logistics cameras.</p>
      <p class="p2"> &#x25A0;	This was done to establish an overall budget for marketing, staff incentives, and committee meetings. 15% of overall losses went to marketing plan.</p>

      <li>Responsible for the daily analysis of Elementary, Middle, and High School breakfast and lunch programs, and how they performed with demographically suited units across our district. Overall Job Responsibility was to isolate the most appropriate marketing programs in our corporate database suited to our specified business unit, and specific to the current need of our customers.</li>
      <p class="p1"> &#x25A0; This was done by isolating food options and analyzing their daily, weekly, and monthly performances; finding inches of growth by introducing food products that suited current trends (stuffed pizza, vegetarian products, smoothies, etc.), and launching marketable campaigns tailored to those products.</p>
      How:
      <p class="p2"> &#x25A0; Daily, I maintained (+created) excel charts populated with data from our POS, tracking key items and troubled schools. If an elementary school had a struggled month, I would boost morale by scheduling mascot appearances, make trips to unit for marketing and customer service checks, launch a marketing campaign from our corporate database. Similarly, with middle and high schools. This data would be logged and saved for performance, ease of re-usability, and effectiveness. </p>
      <p class="p2"> &#x25A0; Holistically, I would perform survey analysis (paper + survey monkey - slow system’s upgrades) to decipher between food excitement, customer choice, and choice popularity. Next, I would create excel spreadsheets and pivot charts to clean data and showcase likely/unlikely, popular, unique, and pricey selection options. I would then include this in a report, with next steps and options available through our local produce vendor, sending report to the Operations and General Manager for discussion – Done every 6 months.</p>
